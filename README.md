# Open Computing Club QR and recruitment generator

Written with Gemini-CLI and Qwencode. Both are absolute dogshit coding agents. Please use Claude-code.

# Running this TUI CLI App
# MAKE SURE YOU GOT RUST INSTALLED OKAY!
I used Rust for this because I was a masochist.
------------
Just pull the repo and "cargo build" then "cargo run" if you wanna use this "app"
OR
Use the run.sh if you hate typing commands.

# WHy tf does this thing exist?
Cuz I am lazy to go to Canva or use Affinity Studio (yea it's owned by Canva but I hate Affinity now) and make new posts for recruitment every damn time. Might as well use new ascii and ask AI to swap out the ASCII line by line.

(I might just make an algorithm to f(x) insert the ASCII after getting an algorithm to parse it.)
